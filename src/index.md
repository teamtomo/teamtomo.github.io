*modular Python packages the cryo-ET community can depend on*

**The goal of teamtomo is to provide:**

- [x] a place for high quality Python packages that the community can rely on
- [x] a place for developers to learn and build things together


!!! note "Why?"

    Python is a great language for image analysis. We make interacting with and
    analysing cryo-EM data from Python easier by providing useful packages.


Please take a look at the list of packages for [Input/Output](site/io_packages.md) and [Image Analysis](site/image_analysis_packages.md) for a description of existing packages.


**Key ideas**

- packages are small, modular and easy to install
- package scope is limited and well defined
- APIs are [Pythonic](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) and [type hinted](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- code is [tested](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)

If this seems daunting, we're here to help, please reach out by posting on [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/teamtomo))!

**Development model**

Because packages in *teamtomo* are small and well scoped it is easy to 
depend on only those packages relevant to your work. 

*teamtomo* is **not** a place for the development of your own software projects. 
Your projects belong to you and the credit should be yours alone! 
Did you develop a small, reusable component along the way that could benefit the 
entire community? We would love to work with you to bring it here.

**Work with us**

Interested in working with us in some way? Fantastic, Welcome aboard! 

Most discussion should happen on [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/teamtomo) so it is easy to find when searching online.

For realtime chat we use image.sc's [zulip](https://imagesc.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/426493-TeamTomo), a chat platform open to all for discussing details about the project.
